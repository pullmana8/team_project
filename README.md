Trivia Game

Express, Angular + Material

This is a Team Project that was completed in Fall 2016 for our software development internship we had.

Due to our contribution, we were able to create a Trivia Game utilizing the Open Trivia Database: https://opentdb.com/

However, for my intention, I am revamping the trivia game to be used a prototype game trivia for Android/iOS systems.
